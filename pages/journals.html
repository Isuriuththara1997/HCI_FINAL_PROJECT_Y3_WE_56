          Our philosophy's pretty simple: we don't take life, or fashion, too
          seriously. Like the bestie you can always count on, we’ve got all the
          outfits and inspo you could ever need. From date-night dresses to a
          pick-me-up when you’ve had a bad day, we’ll never let you down.

                    Eight Outfit Ideas to Wear Girls’ Denim Jackets With Style
                  </h5>
                  <p class="card-text">
                    Since the retro era of the 1980s’, denim jackets have been a
                    permanent feature in popular culture. And it is not just
                    youngsters flaunting them. Denim jackets are now being
                    designed for young girls and even toddlers, opening numerous
                    opportunities in styling. While some twin with their parents
                    or siblings, others embrace the stylistic experiments that
                    their parents try their hand at. Now, don't get us wrong:
                    We, too, love cool, of-the-moment silhouettes and the
                    endless style inspiration from the IG pros that wear them.

                  When fellow plus size shoppers ask me the best way to find
                  style inspiration or cute clothes, I always say social media.
                  Following stylish plus size women on Instagram has been key to
                  my own personal style journey and has led me to more unique
                  pieces (and confidence) than anything else.Ahead, Sunita tells
                  us all about how her easy, non-cliché outfits come together,
                  her secret to adding just the right amount of flair to every
                  look, and why individuality is the key to winning style.

                    If you follow a slew of fashion girls on Instagram, chances
                    are, you've likely already seen most of the season's biggest
                    trends (think: plaid boyfriend blazers, sparkly boots, and
                    puff-sleeved blouses) in your feed a dozen times over. Now,
                    don't get us wrong: We, too, love cool, of-the-moment
                    silhouettes and the endless style inspiration from the IG
